# Binnacle

Binnacle is an app where you can store all your travel notes and share them with anyone you like.

## Motivation and project progress

During my last vacation i wanted to share with a determined number of people insights, pictures and stories regarding my traveling. 

I used Instagram for this matter with a private account so i can control the scope of people being able to access my posts and updates. 

Problem was, some folks don't have Instagram. Also, after the vacation, some people also ask about details on budget, planning and places to visit.

From a product perspective, the purpose of this project is to MVP a simple app to track travel plans and being able to share them privately without the requirement of having an account.

From a dev perspective, the purpose is to have a side-project where to find, experiment and learn.
